            <p>Pinus virginiana, the Virginia pine, scrub pine, Jersey pine, Possum pine, is a medium-sized tree, often
                found on poorer soils from Long Island in southern New York south through the Appalachian Mountains to
                western Tennessee and Alabama. The usual size range for this pine is 9–18 m, (18–59 feet) but can grow
                larger under optimum conditions. The trunk can be as large as 20 inches diameter. This tree prefers
                well-drained loam or clay, but will also grow on very poor, sandy soil, where it remains small
                andstunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years</p>

            <p>The short (4–8 cm), yellow-green needles are paired in fascicles and are often twisted. Pinecones are 4–7
                cm long and may persist on the tree for many years, often (though not always) releasing their seeds in
                the second year. In growth habit, some trees may be inclined with twisted trunks.</p>

            <p>This pine is useful for reforesting and provides nourishment for wildlife. Its other main use is on
                Christmas tree farms, despite having sharp-tipped needles and yellowish winter color. It also can
                provide wood pulp and lumber. Like some other southern yellow pines, Virginia pine lumber case hardens.
                That is, it becomes very hard over time during wood drying. Wood from Virginia pine is not normally
                considered to resist rot unless treated with preservatives.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <section class="description-body">
        <div class="description-text">
            <p>Pinus virginiana is endemic to the United States and can be identified by a key characteristic; the
                relatively short needles are twisted and come in bunches of two. The needles are typically two to eight
                centimeters in length. There is hair on the bracts and on the bud scales of the P. virginiana. The leaf
                sheath of the P. virginiana is greater than 2.5 millimeters long. The cones of the P. virginiana only
                open after they are mature. The branches of the Pinus virginiana are flexible. They will bend when
                pressure is added to them.[2] Pinus virginiana are between 9 and 18 meters tall. The bark of P.
                virginiana is red and brown in color, and also has the tendency to be rough with relatively small bark
                scales. The pollen cones are circular, almost elliptical and are 10–20 millimeters in size. They are the
                same color as the bark, typically. Seed cones are spread throughout the tree. The mature seed cones (4–7
                cm) are much larger than the pollen cones.[3] The P. virginiana prefers to grow in poor soils and dry
                loam or clay. They can grow on sandy soil, but this usually causes the tree to be smaller than the
                average P. virginiana</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>

    <section class="taxonomy-body">
        <div class="tax-text">
            <p>Pinus virginiana is in the family Pinaceae and the order Pinales.[2] A molecular phylogeny indicates that
                the sister taxa to Pinus virginiana are Pinus clausa, Pinus contorta, and Pinus banksiana.[5] Pinus
                banksiana has shorter needles than P. viginiana at 2–3.5 centimeters in length, whereas P. virginiana is
                2–8 centimeters in length. P. banksiana needles are not twisted, but curved, and has cones that are
                serotinous and unarmed. The leaf sheaths in P. banksiana are less than 2.5 millimeters long. In P.
                virginiana the needles are twisted and straight. The cones open at maturity, are not serotinous and the
                scales on the cones have prominent prickles. The sheaths of the P. virginiana are greater than 2.5
                millimeters long. Pinus clausa has larger needles than the P. virginiana. The Pinus clausa has needles
                that are between 5 and 13 centimeters long, P. virginiana has needles that range between 2 and 8
                centimeters long. Pinus clausa is also serotinous.[2] Lastly, Pinus virginiana and Pinus contorta are
                distributed differently: Pinus virginiana are found on the eastern side of the United States, whereas
                Pinus contorta are found on the western side.[6] A similarity between Pinus virginiana and Pinus
                contorta is that the needles of both species are twisted.</p>

    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <section class="distribution-body">
        <div class="dist-text">
            <p>Pinus virginiana inhabit dry forested areas. The tree occurs in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
                Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
                Mississippi,[2] Indiana, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware.[3] In locations where the P. virginiana
                lives, rainfall is typically between 890 and 1400 millimeters. The average temperatures in the summer
                are between 21–24 degrees Celsius and in the winter it is around −4 to 4 degrees Celsius. Pinus
                virginiana is poorly adapted to fire, but if the tree is larger they are able to survive. Open growth
                Virginia pines may begin cone production at only 5 years old. There have been documented cases of trees
                as young as 18 months beginning to flower. Virginia pine is monecious and some self-pollination is
                possible, but a significant seed crop requires two trees. Cones take two complete growing seasons to
                develop. Pollination takes place 13 months after cone formation begins, and dispersal occurs the
                following autumn. Unlike some other pines, Virginia pine produces cones in all parts of the canopy.[5]
                Pinus virginiana is reportedly naturalized in southern Ontario</p>

            <p>Cherokee Indians used P. virginiana medicinally. They used it for many symptoms like diarrhea, stiffness
                of the body, colds, fevers, hemorrhoids, tuberculosis, and constipation. Cherokee Indians used P.
                virginiana in different ways including bathing in water that had been soaked in the bark, steams and
                oils, root and needle infusions, and for tar. They also used it in certain cultural rituals. In burial
                rituals P. virginiana branches were burned and the ashes were used for a fire in their homes. Also, they
                would infuse needles in apple juice and they would drink it. The Cherokee basically did that as a toast
                to the wind. Lastly, they used the root infusions as a stimulant and the needles were used as a soap.[5]
